# Ryan's Code Snippets

I really wanted a place to dump bits and pieces of code I use for easy copy-pasta. So here we are!

## Wait... why isn't this a library? `npm install` or GTFO.

Good point! Maybe one day. For now, I just want a dumping ground for snippets I regularly use so I don't have to go hunt for them in old projects anymore. This probably means there will be a little bit of code duplication in some files.

## The rules

- For maximum JavaScript compatibility I plan to stick to ES5 for now. I love me some ES6, but ideally these things should work without a transpiler.
- When defining Sass mixins and functions they will always be in `.scss` format.
